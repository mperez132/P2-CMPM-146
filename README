This is our implementation of the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm for use in Ultimate Tic Tac Toe. mcts_vanilla includes the base implementation. mcts_modified includes our additional work to create a more performant mcts bot, including multithreading and node memory. mcts_murderbot is a fun third addition that better utilizes the mcts_modified program by exploring for a specified time limit.
